It generates relative-abundance timecourses under perturbations for an arbitrary number of time points, samples, locations and data types. All simulation parameters are exposed to the user to facilitate rapid power analysis and aid in study design. Users who want additional flexibility may also use MiSDEED as a Python package.MiSDEED is written in Python and is freely available at https://github.com/pchlenski/misdeed.}, number={1}, journal={Bioinformatics Advances}, author={Chlenski, Philippe and Hsu, Melody and Peâ€™er, Itsik}, year={2022}, month={Jan}, pages={vbac043} }

This document is a brief description of available network inference methods. It is intended to be a quick reference for people who are familiar with the methods but not familiar with the implementations. For more details, please refer to the original papers.

## Lotka-Volterra based methods

### Compositional Lotka-Volterra

[@Joseph_Shenhav_Xavier_Halperin_Peer_2020] proposed a framework based on compositional Lotka-Volterra (cLV) equations to infer the network structure and the parameters of the network. The framework is based on the following assumptions:
